abstract:
    - This paper describes $n$ methods for fitting a binary supervised learning classifier on a single large dataset with multiple-typed features. Timing and accuracy metrics are presented for each method, with analysis on the results in terms of the structure of the data set. Fits were performed using the popular open-source machine learning library `scikit-learn`. Additionally, a code repository including all necessary infrastructure has been developed and shared for reproducibility of results. 

# System Design
For portability and reproducibility of results, we have elected to use the Docker system and its `Dockerfile` syntax to prepare. As this work is done using Python and its `scikit-learn` libraries we have elected to use a system built via the Anaconda package manager. Furthermore, leveraging images designed by and for using the Jupyter system, which is built via Anaconda, allows a single container to be used both for running the analysis script and for interactive analysis of the data via Jupyter. The following `Dockerfile` completely describes the system used for this work. Note that it inherits from a Docker image designed and maintained by the [Jupyter team](https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/scipy-notebook/). 

## `mlnd/tcsl Dockerfile` 
```
FROM jupyter/scipy-notebook
VOLUMES .:/home/jovyan/work
```

Via the above, fit analysis can be run on a single classifier,

```
$ docker run -e CLASSIFIER='decision tree' mlnd/tcsl python project.py
```

all classifiers,

```
$ docker run mlnd/tcsl python project.py
```

or via an interactive notebook server

```
$ docker run mlnd/tcsl
```
 
Note that the last leverages a built-in launch script inherited from the original notebook definition, in that no explicit command was passed to the container.

# Data Set
Select a dataset
Proposed requirements:
- Large but not too large i.e. can fit on a single system running Docker
- lends itself to binary classification
- many different types of feature parameters
- from [UCI Machine Learning Dataset Library](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html)

# Data Visualization


# Feature Engineering
one-hot encode classification parameters
convert all booleans to numeric values

# Split Data Set
- training
- test
- use seed for reproducibility
